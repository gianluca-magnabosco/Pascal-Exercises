# This is my first ever repository

## Pascal algorithm exercises

On this repository you can find a list of solved algorithm and programming exercises and college tests, made by myself as a student of System Analysis and Development in Curitiba, Brazil which means my mother tongue is Portuguese, however, all repositories will be written in English as a standard even though they may contain portuguese content, such as the present repository.
